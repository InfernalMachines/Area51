		This was a triumph!<br />
		I'm making a note here:<br />
		Huge success!<br />
		It's hard to overstate<br />
		my satisfaction.<br />
		Aperture Science:<br />
		We do what we must<br />
		<a href ="#" class="removeMe"><span id="removeThis">because we can</span>
		</a><br />
		For the good of all of us.<br />
		Except the ones who are dead.<br />
		But there's no sense crying<br />
		over every mistake.<br />
		You just keep on trying<br />
		'til you run out of cake.<br />
		And the science gets done.<br />
		And you make a neat gun<br />
		for the people who are<br />
		still alive.<br />
		I'm not even angry...<br>
		I'm being so sincere right now.<br>
		Even though you broke my heart,<br>
		and killed me.<br>
		And tore me to pieces.<br>
		And threw every piece into a fire.<br>
		As they burned it hurt because<br>
		I was so happy for you!<br>
		Now, these points of data<br>		
		make a beautiful line.<br>
		And we're out of beta.<br>
		We're releasing on time!<br>
		So I'm GLaD I got burned!<br>
		Think of all the things we learned!<br>
		for the people who are<br>
		still alive.<br>
		Go ahead and leave me...<br>
		I think I'd prefer to stay inside...<br>
		Maybe you'll find someone else<br>
		to help you.<br>
		Maybe Black Mesa?<br>
		That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!<br>
		Anyway this cake is great!<br>
		It's so delicious and moist!<br>
		Look at me: still talking<br>
		when there's science to do!<br>
		When I look out there,<br>
		it makes me glad I'm not you.<br>
		I've experiments to run.<br>
		There is research to be done.<br>
		On the people who are<br>
		still alive.<br>
		And believe me I am<br>
		still alive.<br>
		I'm doing science and I'm<br>
		still alive.<br>
		I feel fantastic and I'm<br>
		still alive.<br>
		While you're dying I'll be<br>
		still alive.<br>
		And when you're dead I will be<br>
		still alive<br>
		Still alive.<br>
		Still alive.<br>
